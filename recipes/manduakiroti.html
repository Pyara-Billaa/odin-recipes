        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This roti is nutritious, rich in calcium and fiber, and traditionally eaten in Uttarakhand, especially in winter for its warming effect. It is a staple in Kumaoni cuisine and pairs well with simple local accompaniments.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups Mandua flour (finger millet flour)</li>
            <li>About 3 cups wheat flour (can vary; some recipes use less wheat flour or only mandua flour)</li>
            <li>Water as required (lukewarm)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Ghee for serving (optional)</li>
            <li>Jaggery or garlic salt as accompaniments (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the mandua flour and wheat flour well with salt.</li>
            <li>Gradually add lukewarm water to form a stiff dough. Do not add too much water as mandua flour is gluten-free and can become sticky.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough well and divide it into small balls.</li>
            <li>Flatten each ball with your palms or roll gently to form rotis. If the roti cracks, you can apply a little water to the edges.</li>
            <li>Heat a tawa (griddle) on medium flame. Cook each roti on the tawa, flipping to cook both sides until golden brown spots appear.</li>
            <li>Optionally, cook the roti on direct flame for 1-2 minutes to puff it up.</li>
            <li>Brush the hot roti with ghee for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with green salt (hara namak), chutney, jaggery, or a vegetable curry.</li>
        </ol>
