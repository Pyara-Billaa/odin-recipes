    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish highlights the rustic, earthy flavors typical of Kumaoni cuisine, emphasizing minimal but impactful spices. The use of mustard oil and garlic gives it a distinctive pungency and warmth that complements the protein-rich black soybeans.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Bhatt ki dal (black soybeans)</li>
        <li>3–4 tbsp mustard oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 tbsp whole coriander seeds</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp hing (asafoetida)</li>
        <li>15-20 garlic cloves, whole or roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium green chilies, slit</li>
        <li>3–4 tbsp wheat flour (to thicken)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp red chili powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>A handful of fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>Water as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the black soybeans (bhatt) well, soak them if preferred.</li>
        <li>Heat mustard oil in a heavy pan or kadhai. Add cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and hing. Let the seeds crackle.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic cloves and sauté till they turn light brown and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and green chilies. Sauté until onions become soft and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until oil starts to separate from the mixture.</li>
        <li>Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, salt, and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the black soybeans and mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Gradually add water as needed and bring it to a boil. Cover and simmer until the bhatt is cooked and soft (about 20-30 minutes).</li>
        <li>Mix wheat flour with a bit of water to make a smooth slurry. Add this to the curry to thicken the gravy. Stir continuously to avoid lumps.</li>
        <li>Cook for another 5-10 minutes until the gravy thickens and flavors meld.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
        <li>Serve hot traditionally with steamed rice or mandua roti.</li>
    </ol>
